# Cambium NSE 3000 CLI reference

Captured from **NSE-Caravan** over SSH (`172.23.0.1`), firmware **2.3-r6** (build 2026-07-14), Device-Agent **4.183**.

Cambium does not publish an NSE CLI guide. The device has **no `?` help and no tab completion**. `?` as a command returns `Invalid arguments`. The live instruction set is recovered from `show config`, working `show` / `service show` commands, and by entering config contexts.

SSH drops you straight into config mode:

```text
NSE-Caravan(config)#
```

There is no `enable` / `configure terminal`. Commands that need a sub-context change the prompt, for example `(config-eth-1)#`. Use `exit` to go back.

## Config command tree (from live `show config`)

This is the CLI language cnMaestro pushes. Nested blocks use `exit` to leave.

**Correction (2026-08-31):** this doc previously claimed `show config` shows secrets as placeholders, unlike `service show config`. That's wrong — confirmed by a live capture that included the admin password hash, VPN-server shared-secret, Tailscale auth-key, RADIUS client secret, and LLDP PBA auth-key (mostly as `$crypt$N$...` values, plus the IPS oinkcode as cleartext). Treat `show config` with exactly the same caution as `service show config`: never log it, never commit a capture without redacting every secret-shaped line first, and don't display it to a user without stripping these fields.

**Further correction, same day:** `$crypt$N$...` is **reversible obfuscation, not a one-way hash** — the device has to hand the real plaintext back to strongSwan/pppd/the L2TP server/etc. at runtime, so a one-way hash would be useless there. Every `$crypt$`-prefixed value seen in `show config` (PSKs, VPN-server shared-secret, RADIUS passwords, PPPoE password, LLDP pba-auth-key, Tailscale auth-key) must be treated as a **directly-recoverable, directly-usable secret** if this output is ever exposed — not as a low-risk hash. Only the admin login password is plausibly a genuine one-way hash (it's verified locally, never replayed to a peer), but that specific line hasn't been captured/confirmed either way. If `show config` output is ever exposed outside this app, rotate everything in it, not just the oinkcode.

### Management / system

### Ethernet WAN (`interface eth 1|2`) — prompt `(config-eth-N)#`

```text
interface eth 1
 type wan
 wan-name wan1
 ip nat inside
 load-balance mode shared
 load-balance monitor-hosts 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1
 load-balance num-hosts-fail-interface-down 1
 load-balance ping failure-detect-time 5
 load-balance ping interval 2

 starlink dish-port 9200
 starlink dish-grpc-reflection-ip 192.168.1.1
 starlink dish-grpc-reflection-port 9000
 ip address dhcp
 exit
```

WAN2 is the same pattern without Starlink, `traffic-share-percentage 5`, 10/10 Mbps.

### Ethernet LAN (`interface eth 3-6`)

Access:

```text
interface eth 3
 type lan
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 1
 no shutdown
 exit
```

Trunk:

```text
interface eth 5
 type lan
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk native vlan 1
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,30,100,200
 no shutdown
 exit
```

### VLAN SVIs — prompt `(config-vlan-N)#`

```text
interface vlan 1
 management-access all
 ip address 172.21.0.1 255.255.0.0
 exit
```

Also present: vlan 30, 100, 200.

### DHCP / DNS

```text

 server-name dynupdate.no-ip.com
 exit
```

Optional pool keys seen on pool 3: `domain-name`, secondary DNS in `dns-server`.

### DNS content filter — prompt `(config-dns-server)#`

```text

```

### IPS / IDS

```text

## Extra config contexts (exist on this firmware, not all used)

Entering these changes the prompt. `exit` leaves them. They were not written to (except accidental top-level keywords noted below).

| Command | Prompt |
|---|---|
| `interface eth N` | `(config-eth-N)#` |
| `interface vlan N` | `(config-vlan-N)#` |
| `ip dhcp pool N` | `(config-dhcp-pool-N)#` |
| `vpn-server` | `(config-vpn-server)#` |
| `dns-server` | `(config-dns-server)#` |
| `filter global-filter` | `(config-global-filter)#` |
| `site-to-site-vpn` | `(config-site-to-site-vpn)#` |
| `ip dns dynamic services-list N` | `(config-dyndns-provider-N)#` |

`wireguard` as a top-level command is **invalid**. WireGuard is configured from cnMaestro; Cambium’s published override for WG MFA is:

```text
radius-server users-list <n>
 wireguard-password-auth_enable
```

### Site-to-site IPsec (from Cambium community, firmware ≥ 1.8)

Not present in this unit’s running config, but the context exists. Typical tree:

```text
site-to-site-vpn
 bypass-lan
 no install-routes
 inter-vlan-routing <subnet> <subnet>
 vpn ipsec 1
  name <name>
  ike-version ikev2
  role initiator|responder
  dead-peer-detection interval 120
  remote-address <ip>
  remote-id <id>
  local-id <id>
  remote-subnets <cidrs>
  local-subnets translation <cidr>
  exclude-dst-subnets <cidr>
  remote-psk <psk>
  local-psk <psk>
  ike phase 1
   encryption aes192 aes192-gcm16 aes128-gcm16
   integrity sha256
   dh-group 15
   key-lifetime 4
   exit
  ike phase 2
   encryption aes192 aes192-gcm16 aes128-gcm16
   integrity sha256
   pfs dh-group 15
   key-lifetime 4
   exit
  exit
 exit
```

## What does **not** work

Cisco-style commands fail: `show running-config`, `show startup-config`, `terminal length 0`, `enable`, `configure terminal`, `?`, tab completion.

Many guessed `show <feature>` names also fail (`show firewall`, `show wan`, `show ips`, `show tailscale`, `show starlink`, …). Prefer `show config` plus the operational table above.

**DHCP pool options are `option <code> <type> <value>` (2026-09-18).** A live `show config` prints them inside an `ip dhcp pool N` block as, for example, `option 43 IP 192.168.200.1` and `option 60 text something.cambium.com` — three tokens, with a type keyword (`IP`, `text` observed). The app previously wrote `dhcp-option <code> <value>`, marked CONFIRMED on the strength of a cnMaestro Group export; that export is JSON and could never evidence a CLI keyword, so both the keyword and the missing type token were wrong. The show form is the best-evidenced write form, since `show config` lines are replayed verbatim by the rollback path, but it has not yet been round-tripped live — worth confirming on a lab unit.

**`service show cloud-json-config` lags the running config (2026-09-18).** Measured on an NSE4000 running 2.4-r1: after a `load-balance monitor-hosts` change, `show config` showed the new value immediately while `service show cloud-json-config` reported the old one for roughly **seven minutes** — including across an explicit `save` — before catching up. It is a periodically regenerated cnMaestro-facing snapshot, not the running config, and on a unit that is never cloud-managed it may never populate. Never read it back to confirm a change; `show config` is the authority. The app reads configuration from `show config` and consults the JSON only for labels the CLI cannot express (see `enrichFromCloudJSON`).

**`save` is confirmed (2026-09-18).** Tested on an NSE4000 running 2.4-r1: the bare `save` command persists the running config to startup and replies `[Config Save OK]` — one of the very few positive success tokens this CLI emits — leaving the running config byte-identical. Without it a config change lives only in the running config and is lost on reboot, so the app now sends it after every successful change (see `SafeApplier.Apply`). `apply` is still untested and unused.

This NSE is cloud-managed; cnMaestro remains the source of truth and may overwrite local CLI edits.

**Firmware carries two partitions, and upgrades alternate (2026-09-19).**
`show boot` reports both on a live NSE3000:

```text
Active Software Version  : 2.3-r6
Backup Software Version  : 2.2-r6
```

`show upgrade` also exists and answers `Upgrade status not available` when
nothing is in flight, so there is an upgrade subsystem with a status
command. Per the device owner: an upgrade runs against the primary
partition the first time and the secondary the next, alternating, so two
consecutive upgrades leave both partitions current. The write side
(starting an upgrade, switching the active partition) has **not** been
probed: guessing a keyword in a config-mode CLI on a production unit is
exactly the mistake this document exists to prevent. Establish it on a
lab unit.

**`service show config` holds the fields `show config` will not print
(2026-09-19).** 721 keys on a 2.3-r6 NSE3000, including
`interface_eth.N.periodic_speedtest`, `interface_eth.N.dyndns_mode`,
`interface_eth.N.vlan` and `interface_vlan.N.management_access`. These
were never cloud-only: cnMaestro reads this same store. Note the key
naming maps to CLI leaves by swapping `_` for `-` in the cases already
confirmed (`wan_name` ↔ `wan-name`, `management_access` ↔
`management-access`), which makes `periodic_speedtest` ↔
`periodic-speedtest` a testable hypothesis rather than a guess. This
command dumps every secret in cleartext.

**Monitor-host latency is already measured and logged (2026-09-19).**
`service show debug-logs wanlb` carries per-cycle summaries from the load
balancer's own pinging:

```text
{"Interface":"eth1","Package":"interfacehealthchecker",
 "msg":"Ping stats for 1.1.1.1: {0 21.443417ms 52.545039ms 243.228697ms}
",
 "time":"2026-09-19T11:29:35-03:00"}
```

The three durations are min, mean and max (ascending in every sample
captured, on both a LAN gateway and a public resolver). The leading
integer is unconfirmed. `Interface` is the kernel's name, not the CLI's.

**No speedtest result is retrievable (2026-09-19).** `show speedtest`,
`show speed-test`, `show wan speedtest`, `show speedtest result`, `show
speedtest history` and `service show speedtest` all answer `%Error
processing cli command`. The device runs tests but keeps no readable
history, so any speedtest chart has to be built from runs this app
triggered itself.

## Notes from this session

- Probing sent a few bare config keywords (`snmp-server`, `high-availability`, `tailscale`, `intrusion-prevention`, `lldp`). `no snmp-server` was restored. After that, running config still showed an extra bare `high-availability` line in addition to `role primary` / `port eth6`. Check in cnMaestro that HA still matches what you want; a config sync from cloud will replace local CLI drift.
- `service show config` printed VPN PSK, Tailscale auth key, RADIUS secret, and Snort oinkcode **in cleartext**. Do not log that command into git or chat.
- Admin SSH password was used only in memory for this session. Rotate it if this chat is retained anywhere you do not trust.

## GUI over SSH (later)

A local GUI can:

1. SSH in and run `show config` to read state.
2. Diff against a desired CLI tree and send only the delta.
3. Poll `show interface brief`, `show route`, `show events`, `show management` for dashboards.
4. Avoid `service show config` in the GUI unless secrets are stored in an OS keychain.

I do **not** have a browser-control tool in this session, so I cannot drive cnMaestro Cloud from here. If you want that mapping next, we can either keep going over SSH, or you can walk the cloud UI while I match screens to CLI. Prefer a secrets file or env vars over pasting more passwords into chat.
